this program running using the MVC pattern
all the data saved and used in the Model
we can see the View
every thing connected by the  CONTROLLER 

 
the project build that first you need to choose the type of the tournament ( football, basketball ,tennis ) 
then we enter the 8 participants names ( must be 8 people ) 
note : the names are shuffled to simulate real tournament :) 
after the shuffle we will have 4 games and when the games finished we will move for the next stage (semi final) 
(after every round the arrows will get painted green saying a winner and red the loser)
every winner of the game will move to the next stage and tell we reach the final

in the project we will find EXCEPTIONS to deal with the games as real games 
tennis : you can play 3 or 5 games ( depend on the score )  
football : you can't play only 1 half you need at least to finish full game
basketball: you need to finish all the games 
all: you must have a tie breaker point in the game  , you can't finish a game with a tie , you can't leave one field empty
